## Was Working
But is now not, some thing to do with the adapter delegate and the navigation drawer fragment, as the middle list was working as a listview.
Best practices are consistent in the app, using all but the parcelablePlease library.

TODO  - find the bug in the recycler view in the navigation drawer. See if suggestion gets adopted(combine annotatedAdapter and adapterDelegeates when you can)
